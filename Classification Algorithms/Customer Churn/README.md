* Used a **Logistic Regression** algorithm that predicts if clients will stay with the company (**Log loss 60%**), given Tenure, Age, Address, Income, Education, Employment and Equip.
* **Pre-Processed** the data by filtering for the most appropriate variables.
* Split the data with a **Test Size** of 0.2.
* Optimized the **Logistic Regression** algorithm by using an **Liblinear Solver** and a **Inverse of regularization strength** of 0.01 to obtain the best model.
* Plotted a **Confusion Matrix** of the **Model Results**.<p>
