* Applied a **K-Means** algorithm that clusters customers into groups based on Age, Education, Employment Years, Income and Debt.
* **Pre-Processed** the data deleting categorical variables.
* Normalized the data using the **Standard Scaler**.
* Optimized the K-Means number of **Clusters** to 3 and number of consecutive runs in terms of inertia to 12, in order to achieve the best model.
* 3-D Plotted the **Model Results**.<p>
