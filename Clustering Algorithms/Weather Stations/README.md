# ML Clustering: Weather Stations
<img src="https://relor91.github.io/Lorenzo_Portfolio/images/DBSCAN_Folium.jpg" alt="drawing" width="350" align="left"/><p>
* Used a **DBSCAN** algorithm that that clusters Weather Stations by location and precipitation.
* Optimized the **DBSCAN** algorithm by using selecting for the most appropriate **Epsilon** and a **Minimum Number of Samples** to obtain the best clustering.
* Plotted a **Folium Map** of the **Clustered Results**.<p>
